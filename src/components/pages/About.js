            I'm a full-time student at UC Berkeley learning skills in web development. These skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, MySql, Mongo, React, and GraphQL among
            others. I'm excited to build beautiful web interfaces and applications. You can 
            view some examples on this site.
