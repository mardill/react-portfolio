            I'm a full-time student at UC Berkeley learning skills in web development and full-stack 
            engineering. These skills include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js and Express.js among
            others. I'm excited to build beautiful web interfaces and applications. You can 
            view some examples of my recent work below!
